      <h2>Copyright Infringement Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Soulioli respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), Soulioli will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to our designated copyright agent.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What is the DMCA?</h3>
      <p>
        The DMCA provides a legal procedure for copyright holders to request the removal of content that allegedly infringes upon their rights. If we receive a proper DMCA takedown notice, we will remove the allegedly infringing content and notify the content provider.
      </p>
      
      <h3>DMCA Takedown Notice Requirements</h3>
      <p>To be effective, your DMCA takedown notice must include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.</li>
        <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.</li>
        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>
        <li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
      </ul>
